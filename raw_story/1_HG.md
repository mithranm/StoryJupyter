# Chapter One

I ended last night with my usual dose of Sailor webtoons, my reliable escape into a world of quirky, vibrant stories. Not exactly peak literature, but hey—when you've spent decades watching the internet evolve from doomscrolling to neural feeds, sometimes you just want the comfort of a familiar format. Usually, I stick to Sailor because it never disappoints, but every now and then I crave something completely off the beaten path. That curiosity had me clicking through links until I landed on a site called Parallel Comics.

Parallel was a total mixed bag. You'd find everything from edgy sci-fi to light-hearted rom-coms, but not a single fantasy tale in sight. It felt like every story was set on some version of Earth, almost like the creators were playing it safe to dodge legal drama. The art style was weirdly consistent too, like it was all drawn by the same person but through different filters. As a veteran tech journalist who'd covered everything from the rise of neural interfaces to the collapse of Web2 social media, something about it set off my professional radar.

But that plan didn't work for them. As I was heading to work this morning, the headlines exploded: Beyond Tech slapped Parallel with this massive defamation lawsuit, while Isigny Studios was losing it over finding their unreleased "Dreamers" project all over the site. Beyond was known for their breakthrough metaverse platform—an enormous leap beyond the clunky, fragmented virtual worlds that had come before. The giant wasn't known for legal aggression, which made their sudden move all the more intriguing. Their lawsuit wasn't just about reputation; they claimed Parallel had somehow misrepresented flaws in their research publications. The news was everywhere, and it quickly became clear that this wasn't just another online venture gone wrong because of one key detail.

Investigators had traced Parallel's servers to a network of compromised systems across the Midwest—victims of recent ransomware attacks.

Finally settling at my desk, my first instinct was to run a WHOIS lookup on Parallel's domain, a digital breadcrumb that I hoped would unravel the platform's mysterious origins. What I discovered was so absurd it bordered on dark comedy. Although the registrar had revoked the domain, the archived domain registration details read like a badly constructed cover story. It was registered to an 89-year-old retiree named Harold Jennings in a quiet suburb of Green Bay, Wisconsin.

By the time I reached out, Harold had already become an unwilling media sensation. His unlisted phone number had been overwhelmed with calls from journalists, tech investigators, and random internet sleuths. Local news vans had been camping outside his modest ranch-style home for hours, creating a circus that horrified the typically private man. His daughter Michelle had been forced to create a makeshift media command center in his living room, fielding calls and managing the sudden intrusion into her father's quiet life.

"I've never been so much as mentioned in the local newspaper," Harold released in a public statement, his voice a mixture of exhaustion and bewilderment. "Now I've got reporters from the New York Times asking me about some cartoon thing." He'd taken to wearing noise-canceling headphones around the house to block out the constant ringing of the phone and the shouting of reporters hoping to catch a soundbite.

The police had been called to manage the growing crowd of journalists and internet investigators. What had once been a peaceful neighborhood had transformed into a media staging ground, with Harold at the uncomfortable center of a digital mystery he barely understood. His computer—the supposed source of the domain registration—had been seized by federal investigators, leaving him without the basic machine he used to browse the internet.

When I finally spoke with him, Harold seemed more concerned about getting his computer back than about the millions of dollars of potential liability or the national attention. "I just want my life back," he said, adjusting his hearing aid. "I don't know anything about websites or whatever this Parallel thing is."

I had barely finished a preliminary draft when Sarah, our editor-in-chief, slammed her hands onto my desk. "Markus, I need a story on the Parallel webtoons, and I need it in the next hour!" she barked. It was a good day to be a nerd, once again the perfect person for the job. 

"Bet," I replied, earning an eye-roll as she stormed off. The slang might be ancient, but it never failed to amuse me how it still irritated her. With adrenaline still pulsing, I logged into my laptop and slid on my augmented reality goggles. In an instant, my mundane office dissolved into a dynamic workspace—windows floated in midair, data streams shimmered around me, and every detail pulsed with digital life.

Almost immediately, KAIA's calm voice broke through the visual symphony: "Hacker News is going crazy about leaked source files from Parallel. You need to see this." My ever-vigilant personal agent and research assistant had already been piecing together the chaos. Her meticulously organized interface blossomed before my eyes, data from myriad sources converging into a coherent picture of the unfolding crisis. Basic Logilog searches were a thing of the past; KAIA's ability to connect seemingly unrelated data points made her indispensable.

"They're saying Parallel's total collection of comics is over 100 terabytes," KAIA intoned softly, her voice steady as a forum thread flickered into view. The screen pulsed with endless rows of data. "Torrent archivers are in awe—only a fraction of it was even archived before it was taken offline. But there's something else..." She highlighted a series of technical analyses. "The file signatures aren't matching any standard creation software. It's like looking at art generated by technology that shouldn't exist yet."

I leaned forward, recalling my sleepless notes from last night. "Focus on the sci-fi section—the stuff that got Beyond riled up. I want every scrap from the leak."

KAIA's response was calm. "Compiled and ready." A new window slid into view, each line of archived comics shimmering with meticulous precision. Then, a subtle anomaly in the data caught her attention. "Markus... these files from the leak aren't just unusual. The metadata suggests an architecture I've never encountered before."

The "leak" was the talk of every tech forum. Someone anonymous had claimed they'd extracted source files from Parallel's servers. Instead of exposing security flaws, they'd released a goldmine—every comic's source file, programmatically generated like professional vector graphics. The torrenting community had jumped on it immediately, and that's when things really exploded.

Before I could dig deeper, a video message from Devon appeared. His actual face—not an avatar—wore the same intense expression I remembered from our days covering the Web3 crash together at TechCrunch. Back then, he'd been the one to spot the first signs of the collapse, while I was still chasing flashy NFT stories. These days he ran his own intelligence firm, but he still pinged me whenever something big was brewing.

"Markus, check Isigny's stock, investors are spooked," he said, voice tense with urgency. The market feed confirmed his words: Isigny’s stock had plunged several percentage points since morning.

I exhaled slowly, feeling a mix of amusement and apprehension. The film industry giant had been riding high on their endless supply of artists and proprietary content generation systems, so this kind of market reaction seemed extreme. "Devon, a situation like this would have rattled me too, but this feels overdone. What are we missing?"

Devon ran a hand through his graying hair—a gesture I'd seen countless times during our late-night investigation sessions. "The very existence of Parallel Comics changes everything. It isn’t just about stolen intellectual property. The coherent narratives and impressive visuals show generation capabilities that shouldn't exist yet. The sheer scale defies all logic—its infrastructure costs alone would rival a major tech company's annual budget.” Devon's weathered brow furrowed deeper, etching new lines into the map of creases already carved by time and worry.

KAIA broke the momentary silence, her tone measured yet insistent. "Markus, I've been analyzing the timing patterns in the leaked files. Given Parallel's unconventional setup, this content rollout wasn't just automated—it was orchestrated. The distribution pattern suggests whoever did this wanted the leak to happen, but only after reaching critical mass."

I sat up in my chair, my mind racing. The technical signatures pointed to advanced AI generation, yet FreeML's public systems struggled with creating diverse, coherent narratives beyond a few chapters. The issue of continuity in image generation and vector graphics made it even more puzzling—Standard Diffusion couldn't be responsible.

Devon's face came into focus again. "Markus, Beyond Tech's lawsuit... it's not what we thought. Their defamation claim centers on a specific series that supposedly reveals proprietary neural interface architecture details. But here's the thing—the comics didn't just expose the tech, they predicted its flaws. Ethical dilemmas beyond what its own engineers had even thought of."

I frowned, pulling up the relevant comic series. At first glance, it looked like standard sci-fi fare—a near-future thriller about social networks. But as the story unfolded, it painted a devastating picture of how Beyond Tech's neural interface technology could fragment human consciousness itself. The protagonist, a former Beyond engineer, watched helplessly as people lost their grip on reality, their minds fractured between physical and digital existence.

"The timing is what's really getting to them," Devon continued, rubbing his tired eyes. "Remember those congressional hearings about neural safety protocols? Beyond’s been fighting tooth and nail to keep their development pipeline private. Now this comic comes along, practically writing the opposition's playbook. It's like someone knew exactly which psychological vulnerabilities their tech could exploit."

I nodded slowly. The parallels to the social media controversies of the 2020s were impossible to miss. Back then, it had been Pictogram’s internal research on teen mental health that sparked the firestorm. Now, Parallel was suggesting that Beyond’s neural interfaces could do far worse than affect mood—they could fundamentally alter how human minds process reality.

"KAIA, analyze the series' reception data," I said. "How are people responding to these predictions?"

"The engagement metrics are... concerning," she replied. "Discussion forums are drawing direct connections to historical tech controversies. Several advocacy groups have already cited the comic in their calls for stricter neural interface regulations."

Astonishing. Parallel hadn't just created a compelling story—it had weaponized narrative to expose potential future crises before they could happen. No wonder Beyond was in panic mode.

There wasn't time to chase every tantalizing tangent; the deadline loomed large. I swiftly integrated every fact, every wild speculation, into a tight draft. The idea that this might be a meticulously orchestrated social experiment was explosive—and maybe even snag me a raise.

"KAIA, notify Sarah that I'm ready," I ordered, already removing my AR goggles. I watched their digital overlays dissolve into the pale morning light as I bolted for the elevator. The building's motion-sensor system immediately recognized my intent, but impatience nudged me to request a high-priority call on my phone. My manager might grumble about my constant channel-bypassing, but Sarah had always had a soft spot for my mad dashes.

Inside the elevator, I marveled at the seamless fusion of glass, smart metal, and ever-shifting holographic art. The ambient lighting pulsed in sync with the building's heartbeat, a striking reminder of how far we'd come from the days of clunky screens and static hardware. However, I recalled a visit to the Empire State Building nearly 30 years ago—its art deco charm held a magic that today's technology only hinted at in fleeting digital moments.

When the elevator doors slid open on the twentieth floor, I paused just long enough to take in the soft hum of advanced machinery and the quiet efficiency of the corridor. A quick "Morning!" to the receptionist later, I strode purposefully toward Sarah's office.

I burst through the door. "It's ready!" I declared, my voice carrying a blend of triumph and exhaustion—a testament to the relentless pace of the morning and the urgency of our story.

Sarah looked up, her eyes reflecting both curiosity and the familiar wear of endless deadlines. "I was intrigued by KAIA's summary," she said, then added with a playful smirk, "You could have video-called me, you know." Her tone, warm yet teasing, was a gentle reminder that even in this hyper-digital age, some traditions still held sway.

Sarah was reviewing the news feed on her goggles. The screen streamed live headlines and curated updates: "Digital Dystopia or Social Experiment?" from The New Digital Journal, and "Parallel: Rogue AI or Corporate Espionage?" from Techline. Across the media spectrum, speculation was rife. Traditional outlets, online platforms, and even independent voices in the DC area were buzzing about Parallel. Authorities from the Digital Crimes Unit had released a brief, cryptic statement, calling the site's digital footprint "unprecedented and anomalous," while leading AI research labs praised the content's structure as unlike anything produced by known models.

Sarah removed her goggles as I slid into the chair opposite her. "Markus, your report has begun to explode on every major channel. Media outlets are treating Parallel as either a premeditated social experiment or a sophisticated act of corporate espionage. Meanwhile, authorities remain tight-lipped, and top AI experts are calling this an anomaly," she said, her tone measured yet urgent.

I absorbed her words, feeling the weight of the implications. "Sarah, there are too many unanswered questions here. I need to drop my current projects and dive deeper into Parallel. There's a whole undercurrent here that the story isn't capturing yet."

She regarded me with a mix of determination and concern. "I expected as much. But this isn't a solo venture—I'm assigning you a partner." With a few swift keystrokes on her laptop, Sarah pulled up a detailed profile. "Meet Mika Reyes. She's only 35 and has risen through the ranks at our outlet through sheer grit and talent. Her expertise in digital forensics and cyber investigations will be crucial for unraveling Parallel's mysterious origins."

I paused, intrigued. "Mika Reyes... Devon mentioned her work on the Quantum Leaks case last year. Said she has an uncanny ability to piece together digital trails that others miss."

Sarah nodded, tapping the screen to initiate a secure video link. The image of a young woman with sharp eyes filled the frame. Her avatar didn't try to hide the dark circles under her eyes or the coffee cup clutched in her hand—a refreshing change from the usual corporate polish.

"About time we worked together, Markus," Mika said, a slight smile playing on her lips. "I've been analyzing those leaked Parallel files since they hit the torrents. The metadata doesn't match any known creation pipeline—not FreeML, not Isigny's public releases, nothing in our databases."

"Which raises the question," Sarah interjected, "of who has the resources to build something this sophisticated without leaving a trace. Even state actors would have trouble keeping it completely under wraps."

Mika's avatar nodded. "Exactly. And here's where it gets interesting—the distribution pattern suggests whoever did this wanted the leak to happen. The initial upload was subtle, but the way the content scaled after the leak? That was orchestrated. Someone wanted us to see what their system could do."

I leaned forward, my earlier exhaustion forgotten. "A demonstration? But for who?"

"That's what we need to find out," Sarah said firmly. "I want you two to work together on this. Markus, remember the quantum computing exposé you did last year? About the theoretical limits of current AI systems?" She paused, choosing her next words carefully. "There's a thread here we need to pull. And I want you and Mika to follow it wherever it leads."

I donned my goggles and stepped out of the office, with Mika's image still visible in the picture-in-picture display. "Look, we should discuss this in person. Some things shouldn't be shared over digital feeds, even secure ones."

"Compass in thirty?" Mika suggested, her avatar glancing at something off-screen. "My contact at DARPA's been analyzing the Beyond Tech comics since the hack. Says there are implications they're very interested in discussing."

I nodded, already mapping the route in my head. Compass Coffee had become the unofficial meeting spot for DC's tech journalists and government insiders—close enough to the federal buildings to be convenient, far enough to avoid obvious surveillance. "Defense contracts," I mused. "Beyond’s neural interface program?"

"Among other things," Mika's smile had an edge to it. "When a comic series manages to spook both Silicon Valley and the Pentagon in the same morning, you know we're onto something big."

The morning sun was climbing higher over DC as my thoughts drifted westward, toward Silicon Valley, where I imagined boardrooms were erupting into crisis mode. Whatever was unfolding, I had a feeling we were only seeing the surface ripples of much deeper currents. The real story was still waiting to be found, buried somewhere in the vast sea of data that Parallel had left in its wake.

"See you there," I said, removing my goggles as I stepped into the morning bustle of the capital. Ahead lay the familiar path to Compass, where the next piece of this puzzle waited. Behind me, the Post's building rose into the clear autumn sky, its smart-glass windows reflecting the city's blend of colonial architecture and bleeding-edge technology—a perfect mirror for the story we were chasing.
